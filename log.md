### Day 2: August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I've implemented Object-Oriented Programming design for my flask server. Additionally, I hooked up my heroku database to my application. 

**Thoughts:** Learning python is a little more tedious then I expected. Long-term I will be able to use it for most of my server-side programming thought so I'll stick with it. I plan to use Object Relational Mapping to hook up my heroku database tomorrow.
